				  	<p style="color:black;">Ikhlaq Sidhu is the chief scientist for the Fung Institute for Engineering Leadership in the College of Engineering at UC Berkeley and serves as the primary architect of its curriculum and integrated research. Professor Sidhu joined UC Berkeley in 2005 as founding director of UC Berkeley's highly successful Center for Entrepreneurship & Technology, which has grown to become the cornerstone of the Fung Institute. In 2009, he received a recognition as the 2009 Emerging Area Professor of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at UC Berkeley for his contribution to this new research and teaching area at UC Berkeley.
				  	<br /><br />
					Within industry, he has established new businesses and developed new technologies at U.S. Robotics Corporation, 3Com Corporation, and Cambia Networks. He was awarded 3Com's “Inventor of the Year” award in 1999, and has been granted over 60 US Patents in networking technology, IP telephony, and PDA functionality. Technology and intellectual property from his work has been cross-licensed to Palm Computing, 3Com, and UT Starcom. Sidhu also designed hardware for the first generation of laser printers at Hewlett Packard.
					<br /><br />
					Dr. Sidhu received his bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and his masters' degree and doctorate in Electrical Engineering from Northwestern University.

				  	<li class="fn">Ken Singer, Director</li>
				  	<li class="email"><a href="#">kensinger@berkeley.edu</a></li>
				  	<li>
				  	<p style="color:black;">Ken is a serial entrepreneur, technology executive, university lecturer, and director/advisor to numerous startups in the US and Europe. A 14-year veteran of the mobile industry (enterprise software and digital advertising), Ken has been cre- ating mobile solutions since cellphones first connected to the Internet at a whopping 28 kbps. Since then, he has founded or co-founded five companies in the mobility space. His experience spans all forms of mobile technology, from mobile video streaming to downloadable mobile apps; from Bluetooth to HTML5, GPS, SMS, IVR and he has served as a guinea pig for virtually every other acronym in the industry. He has worked closely with all the usual suspects--telcos, handset manufacturers, GPS mapping providers, SMS aggregators and industry associations.
				  	<br /><br />
					Most recently, Ken was the co-founder and CEO of AppCentral, the first enterprise app store to let companies distribute mobile applications to their employees' iPhones, iPads and Android devices. Ken successfully led the company through diffi- cult market conditions and several rounds of venture financing.
					<br /><br />
					Since 2008, Ken has been teaching the Mobile Applications and Entrepreneurship course in the College of Engineering. One of the first of its kind, the interdisciplin- ary course provides Berkeley students the opportunity to develop a working mobile application and business plan. Students pitch their businesses to active venture capi- talists for a chance to create a real startup company. Ken has been promoting the curriculum around the world through a non-profit organization he started with two of his industry colleagues. Today, the Berkeley Mobile International Collaborative (BMIC) sponsors international competitions for university entrepreneurs. Ken has helped organize the past three competitions which has played host to the best university-based mobile startups from virtually every continent.
					<br /><br />
					Ken is a frequent speaker at industry conferences and has been a guest lecturer at Tsinghua University and CYUPS in Beijing. As a firm believer in paying it forward, Ken is on the board of several startups and continues to advise and invest in some of the most promising mobile companies in the Silicon Valley, Berlin and Paris.
